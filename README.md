# sawntoe's gamelist

This is a list of games I play unironically. Have fun!

## Non-FOSS Games

1. Team Fortress 2

Need I say more? This is the only free game I have ever spent a single cent on, and I 100% do not regret it. [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/)

2. Minecraft

I liek mods :) My recommendation is not to buy from the official site and instead to buy a vpn-activated key. [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/)

3. ULTRAKILL

Best retro indie FPS ever. [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/)

4. Paladins

I find it more fun than Overwatch. [Paladins](https://www.paladins.com/)

5. Osu!lazer

While Osu!lazer is open source, it's assets aren't free. Still a great game though [Github](https://github.com/ppy/osu) [Website] (https://osu.ppy.sh/home)

## FOSS Games

1. Xonotic

Best FOSS Quake-style Arena FPS I have played to date. [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic) [Website](https://xonotic.org/)

2. Warfork: Arena FPS

Normal Quake-style Arena FPS, but much more freedom in movement! [Github](https://github.com/TeamForbiddenLLC/warfork-qfusion/) [Website](https://warfork.com/)

3. OpenArena

Retroooo [Github](https://github.com/OpenArena/gamecode) [Website](http://www.openarena.ws/)

4. Cube 2: Sauerbraten

Very fun once you get the hang of it. Instagib is satisfying af. [Website](http://sauerbraten.org/)

5. Veloren

This is the BEST FOSS RPG, and will BE THE BEST in terms of gameplay and graphics for a LONG TIME. It is still in alpha, so breaking changes may happen, but it's very fun. [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/veloren/veloren) [Website](https://veloren.net/)

6. SuperTuxKart

FOSS Racing game. I love plugging in a controller and just playing arena. [Github](https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code) [Website]()

## Special Mentions: FOSS Games

This is stuff that I haven't touched in a while, but still isn't bad.

1. Unvanquished

Aliens VS Humans. Cool. [Github](https://github.com/Unvanquished/Unvanquished) [Website](https://unvanquished.net/)

2. AssaultCube

Budget CSGO. Still cool. [Github](https://github.com/assaultcube/AC) [Website](https://assault.cubers.net/)

3. OpenSpades

FOSS Ace Of Spades clone. [Github](https://github.com/yvt/openspades) [Website](https://openspades.yvt.jp/)

## Games that I don't like

Games that aren't necessarily my cup of tea, but others may like.

1. SuperTux

Open source Super Mario clone. I don't like the gameplay, but others might. [Github](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux) [Website](https://www.supertux.org/)

2. Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup

A FOSS RPG. Too complicated for my monkey brain. [Website](https://crawl.develz.org/)

3. 0 A.D.

Strategy game. Never liked strategy games. [Website](https://play0ad.com/)


## Games that I never will play again

Shit games.

1. Valorant

Shitty and sometimes toxic, extremely invasive anticheat.

2. CSGO 

Imagine no enemy highlight colour.

3. Polygon

See above.

4. Apex Legends

See above. (YES EVEN WITH BLOODHOUND)
